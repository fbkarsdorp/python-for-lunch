# Python for Lunch

This tutorial provides a brief introduction to Python for the Humanities. The repository can be downloaded by clicking on the "download ZIP" button on the right. Unzip the file and save it somewhere on your computer. In the sections below, I assume that you unzipped the file on your desktop. 

If you want to follow along with the tutorial, please install the Anaconda Python distribution. Direct your browser to [http://continuum.io/downloads#py34](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34) and download the graphical installer. Double-click the downloaded file and install the Python distribution **system-wide**.

Once installed, open a terminal (on Linux or Mac OS X) or a command prompt (on Windows) and first `cd` to the directory in which you saved the tutorial. For Mac OS X users:

    cd /Users/your-user-name/Desktop/python-for-lunch

For Linux users:

    cd /home/your-user-name/Desktop/python-for-lunch

For Windows users:

    cd c:\Users\your-user-name\Desktop\python-for-lunch

where you need to replace `your-user-name` with your actual user name! Next type:

    jupyter notebook

This will launch the jupyter notebook in your browser. Click on the link that says `Python for Lunch.ipynb`. 

If you're unable to install or run the notebook, you can use the following static page. Note that this page doesn't allow you to execute any code:
